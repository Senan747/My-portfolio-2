  "about2": "I got interested in IT fields and after some research, I decided to dive into Front-end development around November 2022. Front-end is a field that deeply resonates with my passion. Working in this area aligns with several qualities that I value. Front-end allows me to create visually appealing and effective interfaces where users can establish a mutual connection. My affection for Front-end grew because it provides me with the opportunity to shape and design my creative ideas. Improving user experiences and creating simple, intuitive interfaces are my primary goals. I always strive to maintain connections with people and am eager to help solve their problems. In the world of Front-end, continuous learning is a lifelong journey for me. Adapting to evolving technologies and emerging trends is a natural requirement in this field. This means I am excited to constantly renew and develop myself further. Lastly, one of the most significant reasons I love Front-end is that it allows me to share my creative ideas with others. Working in this field enables me to express myself and continue sharing my visual concepts with other people.",
